# Task-5: Decision Trees and ransom Forests
## Objective:
Learn tree-based models for classification & regression.
## Tools: 
- Scikit-learn
- Graphviz
- Pandas
- Seaborn
## Steps Followed:
1. Import Data - Heart Disease Dataset
2. Data Preprocessing - Handling missing values and Scaling the data.
3. Trained a Decision Tree model and plot the tree.
4. Tuned the hyperparameters using GridSearch.
5. Trained a Random Forest and compared the accuracy of both the models.
6. Interpreted feature importances using Random Forest.
7. Evaluated using Cross vAlidation.
